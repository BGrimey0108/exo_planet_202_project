# How did changing the mass of Trappistâ€™s Star affect the orbit of its planets?
## Description
Our simulation was created with the intent to model exoplanets change in orbit when the mass of their host star is altered. In order to accomplish this, we analyzed the NASA database of exoplanets for a system of planets to model and eventually chose the TRAPPIST system. Then, using Orbital Py and our data modeling skills learned in CMSE 202, we created the animation you see below.

## Instructions on running the simulation for yourself
- ### First
    - Run cell one to import all necessary packages
- ### Second
    - Run cells 2, 3, and 4 to load in the necessary data and calculate the initial velocity and position of our planets
    - Optional: Run cells 5 and 6 to see the position and velocity vectors 
- ### Third
    - Run cell 7 to initialize all the constants needed to run our simulation
    - Optional: The variable named Ms can be altered to change the mass of the systems star
- ### Fourth
    - Run cell 8 to begin the simulation
    - Note: Wait for the cell to print data ready before continuing 
- ### Fifth
    - Run cell 11 to begin the animation of your simulated orbit
